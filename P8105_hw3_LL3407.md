## Problem 1

``` r
ins_df = 
  instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(nobs=n()) %>% view()

  maximum = ins_df %>% filter(nobs==max(nobs)) %>% view() 
```

-   There are 134 aisles in total.  
-   The “fresh vegetables” aisle is the most ordered from.

``` r
ins_df2 = 
  instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n>10000) %>%
  mutate(number=as.numeric(n)) %>% 
  arrange(number)
```

``` r

    ggplot(aes(x=aisle, y=number, width=5, height=3))+
    geom_point()+
    labs(

-   Description of data “instacart”  
    The “instacart” dataset contains 1,384,607 observations and 15
    variables in total.The Key variables includes order_id, aisle,
    product_name, department, order_dow,etc. For example, a product
    named “Bulgarian Yogurt” located in aisle of “yogurt” and department
    of “dairy eggs” was ordered once with the order number of 4 on
    Thursday with the order ID of “1”. It was a reordered product with 9
    days since prior order.

## Problem 2

``` r
library(tidyverse)
acc_df = read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "activity_minute",
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to = "activity_counts"
  ) %>% 
  arrange(week, day_id) %>% 
  mutate(
    day_num = recode(
      day,"Monday"= 1, 
          "Tuesday"=2,    
          "Wednesday"=3,
          "Thursday"=4,
          "Friday"=5,
          "Saturday"=6,
          "Sunday"=7)) %>% 
    mutate(
    week_day=case_when(
      day_num<6 ~ "weekday",
      day_num>=6 ~ "weekend",
      TRUE ~"")) 
```

    ## Rows: 35 Columns: 1443

    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day
    ## dbl (1442): week, day_id, activity.1, activity.2, activity.3, activity.4, ac...

    ## i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

-   Description the resulting dataset  
    \*\* The resulting dataet “acc_df” has a total of 7 variables
    (week,day_id,day,activity_minute, activity_counts, day_num, and
    week_day)and 50400 observations.

\*\* In addition to the 3 variables kept from the original dataset
(week, day_id, day), we tidy up the dataset with creating two new
varibles (activity_minute and activity_counts).  
\*\* In addition, we convert the character variable “day” into a numeric
variable “day_num”, and use it to classify the weekdays into weekday and
weekend.

``` r
acc_df2 = acc_df %>% 
  group_by(week,day_num) %>% 
  summarize(
    daily_activity = sum(activity_counts)) %>% view()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

-   The total activity counts generally increase from Monday to Friday,
    and decrease on Saturday and Sunday.

``` r
library(ggridges)
accel_plot = 
  acc_df2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=day_num, y=daily_activity, color = week, width=5,height=3),alpha=.5)+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE)+
  labs(
    title = "Daily activity plot",
    x = "days",
    y = "Activity counts",
    caption = "Data from accel data" )+
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7),
    labels = c("Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat","Sun"))+ scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = c(200000,400000,600000),
    labels = c("200,000","400,000","600,000")
    )+ scale_color_gradientn(colors = rainbow(7))

-   From the single-panel plot, we may know that the average daily
    activity counts increase from Monday to Thursday (maximum), and then
    decrease from Thursday to Sunday.  
-   The highest daily activity count is on Monday of Week 3. The lowest
    daily activity count is on Saturday of Week 5.

## Problem 3

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")
```

``` r
noaa_NY = ny_noaa %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, sep="-", into = c("year","month","day" )) %>% 
  mutate(tmin = as.numeric(tmin)/10,
    tmax = as.numeric(tmax)/10,
    prcp = as.numeric(prcp)/10,
    snow_cm = as.numeric(snow)/10) 
  
noaa_NY_1 = noaa_NY %>% 
  group_by(snow) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_obs)) %>% view()
```

-   The most commonly observed values for snowfall is 0. It’s reasonable
    because NY usually only has snowfall in Winter.

``` r
library(patchwork)

noaa_NY_2 = noaa_NY %>% 
  group_by(id,month) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_tmax = mean(tmax),na.rm=TRUE) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(month=="01"|month =="07") %>% 
  mutate(month=replace(month, month=="01","Jan")) %>% 
  mutate(month=replace(month, month=="07","Jul"))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'id'. You can override using the `.groups`
    ## argument.

``` r
tmax_Jan_Jul_plot = noaa_NY_2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=id, y=mean_tmax))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_grid(~month)

tmax_Jan_Jul_plot

-   The average maximum temperatures in July are higher than those in
    January. The average maximum temperatures in July approximately
    range from 24 C to 31 C. The average maximum temperatures in January
    approximately range from -6 c to 6 C. No obvious outlier is
    observed.

``` r
tmax_tmin_plot = noaa_NY %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmax, y = tmin))+
  geom_hex() +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature plot",
    x = "Maximum daily temperature (C)",
    y = "Minimum daily temperature (C)",
    caption = "Data from NOAA National Climatic Data Center" )

snowfall_hist = noaa_NY %>% 
  select(year,snow) %>% 
  mutate(snow = as.numeric(snow)) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>% 
  filter(snow > 0 & snow < 100 ) %>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=snow,width=35,height=5))+
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_grid(.~year)
  
   
tmax_snow_plot = (tmax_tmin_plot+snowfall_hist)
